# Roguelike
Hello, this is my first project which helped me in learning basic of C# (conditionals statements, loops, OOP principles, refactoring).

For now you can choose one from 3 classes (every of them has one unique skill) and try to beat every floor by defeating enemies. 
At each tenth floor you need to face boss (stronger enemy which has skill like the player).
Try to get as much experience as possible, level up and become strong enough to beat the last enemy !

Rewritten code responsible for creating, sorting and getting score.
Added new functionalities (moving on map which is loaded from external file/ requirement for getting into next floor)
[29.01.2022]
Added unit tests
